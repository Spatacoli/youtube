# Go Web Development: The Future of Backend?

This folder contains the `main.go` file used in the video, "Go Web Development: The Future of Backend?" I use the Gorilla Mux in the example and in the video. Gorilla Mux has been archived and the author recommends people use the multiplexor found in `net/http` instead. I made a video, [Go for Web: Retraction](https://youtu.be/ZAfsFUvFFYI) where I describe the situation. Please watch that video and thank you for being  viewer.
